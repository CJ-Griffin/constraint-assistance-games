# TODO Unify the forms of process
# TODO Create debug mode for various functions, pre/post checks and test cases for each CMDP, check for k<K
# CMDP test cases should include, r==0.0 at sinks, tests of all Ts,
# TODO Check the suspect "this only works because this cmdp is deterministic!" stuff
# TODO rewrite names (s_t, s should not be in the same method its confusing af)
# TODO convert CMDP policy to CAG policy
# TODO maybe make special objects for States/Actions (belief states can inheret child and object)
#   (move rendering out of MDP)
#   consider making all States instances of dataclass (immutable)
